# Data-Science
Projects and Activities

These are Data projects I did from the ENSAI - OpenClassrooms courses :

- Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform an Initial Data Analysis
- Use Python libraries for Data Science
- Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis

The last project "Sales Analysis - Customer Segmentation" is a personal one I did from a Kaggle dataset. I could learn more about what Customer segmentation is and the RFM Method used in Data marketing.
